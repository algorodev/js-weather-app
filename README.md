## Introduction

The Weather App is a straightforward, user-friendly application designed to help individuals access real-time weather
information efficiently. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, this app offers a sleek, responsive design that
operates smoothly on both desktop and mobile browsers. Users can quickly view current weather conditions, forecasts, and
temperature readings for multiple locations. The application provides live updates and detailed weather reports,
including humidity, wind speed, all stored and updated directly in the browser for easy access and reference.

## Stack

- **HTML** - Markup language for web pages.
- **CSS** - Styles web content.
- **Javascript** - High-level, interpreted programming language.

## Features

- **Forecast Information**: Displays detailed weather forecasts for upcoming days, helping users plan ahead with weather
  predictions including temperature highs and lows, chance of precipitation, and other relevant details.
- **Location Search**: Users can search for weather information by city. The application should support multiple
  location widgets.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allows users to set preferences for units of measurement (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit).
- **Persistence**: Utilizes local storage or session storage to remember user preferences, recently searched locations,
  and other customizable settings, even after the browser is closed.

## Setup

To use the Weather App, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

### 1. Clone this [repo](https://github.com/algorodev/js-weather-app)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/algorodev/js-weather-app
```

### 2. Move to cloned directory

```bash
cd js-weather-app
```

Since this project consists only of static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), you can open the `index.html` file in any
modern web browser to start using the app immediately.

## Usage

1. **Searching for a Location**: Type the name of the city into the search bar and press `Enter` or click the
   "Submit" button. The app will fetch and display the current weather information for that location.
2. **Deleting Weather Widget**: To remove a weather widget, click the trash icon button located in the top right corner
   of the widget.
3. **Checking the Forecast**: Below or beside the current weather display, you can find the weather forecast for the
   upcoming days. This typically includes highs and lows for temperature and expected weather conditions.
4. **Customizing Settings**: Use the converter button positioned in the right bottom to switch between temperature
   units (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
